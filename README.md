# Project description

Meeting Schedule helps teams solve the difficulty of scheduling a meeting time. It’s a simple but powerful app for anyone who works or studies in a team. Each of the team members only needs to select their available time within the range the host set, then the app will automatically calculate the best available time for everyone. 
​There are many similar apps online, such as when2meet, Google Calendar. We want to build a new one that is more user-friendly and powerful than when2meet, but more simple and light-weighted than Google Calendar. We want to build a more instinctive and simple UI so that anyone with an invite link can use the app easily. At the same time, we want to offer more useful functionalities for the registered user, such as managing their events, creating new events, sharing, etc. 

### Audience 
Students/people who are working in a team, and want to schedule a time for meeting.

### Problem

* Most people work in teams or groups today and they always need to schedule a meeting. However, it’s very difficult to schedule an appropriate meeting time especially when the team is large. Asking each one’s opinion is low-efficient and puts a lot of burden on the hosts. 
* Usually, people belong to multiple groups, which makes scheduling more complex. We need to check our available time manually and it’s easy to get events overlapped.
  Solution
* Any user can create groups and meetings.
* Our application will allow the hosts of groups and meetings to set time ranges and possible places, and send links to invite people to join the meeting groups.
* Any user with a verified link can join in meeting groups. They can also select the best time slot and place according to their preference.
* Registered users can schedule meetings for the same group and with the same settings.
* Registered users can manage multiple meetings and groups. The app will automatically block the time slot that conflicts with other meetings.

### Main Features:

* Set available meeting time by simple selecting
* Create meeting with possible time range, location, participants and more detailed information (such as zoom link)
* Create groups and manage group meeting
* Automatically generate the earliest meeting time based on people’s availability 

### Stretch-goal features:

* Allow user to put preference in the time slot
* Automatically generate a suggested meeting time based on people’s preference

### Comparative analysis

* When2Meet: When2Meet has an un-intuitive UI and is difficult to operate on a mobile phone. Another disadvantage of When2Meet is the need to specify your schedule each time you use it for meeting with a group. 
* Google Calendar: Although it allows people to check free time spots of other people, it does not provide functionality to compare multiple people’s schedules. What’s more, it is not giving users the option to choose where they want to meet.
* Doodle: Doodle is an app that allows an event host to send a survey for the best meeting times. However, Doodle requires attendees to fill out their best times for each individual event.
